# Load athletes_events data 
olympic <- read_csv("/Users/iillari/Documents/gwu/spring2020/intro_dats/eda_project/athlete_events.csv",
                 col_types = cols(
                   ID = col_character(),
                   Name = col_character(),
                   Sex = col_factor(levels = c("M","F")),
                   Age =  col_integer(),
                   Height = col_double(),
                   Weight = col_double(),
                   Team = col_character(),
                   NOC = col_character(),
                   Games = col_character(),
                   Year = col_integer(),
                   Season = col_factor(levels = c("Summer","Winter")),
                   City = col_character(),
                   Sport = col_character(),
                   Event = col_character(),
                   Medal = col_factor(levels = c("Gold","Silver","Bronze"))
                 )
)

```



```{r olympic}
summary(olympic)
```
checking season by sport
```{r}
medalist <- olympic %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Medal)) 

medalist %>%
  group_by(Season, Sport) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
checking sports by average age
```{r}
Sport <- olympic %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Sport)) 


Sport %>% 
  group_by(Sport) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
Checking Season's average of age
```{r}
Season <- olympic %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Season)) 


Season %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Check medalist's average of age.

```{r}

medalist <- olympic %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Medal)) 


medalist %>% 
  group_by(Medal) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```

The medalist gains medals when about 26 years old.

Next, checking the age by sex and seasons.

```{r}

#what
medalist %>%
  group_by(Season, Sex) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
  


```

Checking the average age of the medalists chronologically. 
First, the Summer Olympic Games.


```{r}

summer_medalist <-
medalist %>% 
  group_by(Year, Season, Medal) %>% 
  filter(Season == "Summer") %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )


ggplot(data = summer_medalist, 
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y= mean, group = Medal, color = Medal)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("summer olympic medalist's average of age")



```

In between WW1and WW2", the average age of medalists is decreasing. 
After WW2, the average age temporarily rose. continued decrese until 1980. Stared rising again as of 1980.

```{r}

summer_medalist_sex <-
  medalist %>%
  filter(Season == "Summer") %>% 
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>% 
    summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ggplot(data = summer_medalist_sex, 
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y= mean, group = Sex, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("summer olympic medalist's average of age") +
  ylim(20,35)


```

By sex, men get medals at older age than women
Next, Winter Olympic.

```{r}
medalist_winter <-
  medalist %>% 
  group_by(Year, Season, Medal) %>% 
  filter(Season == "Winter") %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ggplot(data = medalist_winter, mapping = aes(x= Year, y= mean, group = Medal, color = Medal)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_line() 


```

check the average age of the winter olimpic medalists chronologically.

```{r}

season_medalist <-
medalist %>% 
  group_by(Season, Year) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )


ggplot( data = season_medalist, 
  mapping = aes(x= Year, y= mean, group = Season, color = Season)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_line() 



```

The winter Olympic Games are slightly higher than the summer games. 
Has an upward trend as of 1980s.

Next,by sex.
```{r}

winter_medalist <-
  medalist %>% 
  group_by(Year, Season, Sex) %>% 
  filter(Season == "Winter") %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ggplot(data = winter_medalist, 
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y= mean, group = Sex, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("winter olympic medalist's average of age")


```

The d/f between men and women is smaller till the 1990.
